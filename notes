1. Get choice text to be clickable - X
2. Get Wincross test logic working
   - Have tests change on click match the correct WC check qNumber
   - Have bases be included - O
   - Set ability to toggle between bases and previous questions
   - Account for skips with bases or previous questions as suffixes
   - Set question type (singlge/multi/CR etc) - X
3. Display Wincross Checks next to each question
4. Have wincross checks adjust when choice is cliked
5. Have field/method to set skips to choices
   - Ability to calculate all questions that were skipped
     and adust tests accordingly
6. Create test writting method through gui for circumstances
   where App cant figure out test automatically

   class wcInitData {
  constructor(qData) {
    // Set Current Q Number
    this.currentQNumber = qData.qNumber;

    // Set Current Question's Info
    this.currentQuestion = setCurrentQuestion(qData.questions);

    // Set Current Choice's Info
    this.currentChoices = setCurrentChoices(qData.choices);

    // Find the choice type for this question
    this.currentQType = setChoiceType(this.currentQuestion);

    // Set initial passChoices
    this.passChoices = setPassChoices(currentChoices);

    // Set data length of choices ie. 1/10:3 (:3 is the data length)
    this.dataLength = setDataLength(currentChoices);

    // Set current card number
    this.currentCardNum = setCurrentCardNum(currentChoices);

    // Set current column number
    this.firstColumnNum = getColNum(currentChoices);
  }

  // Set tests prefix/suffix based on question type
  directByQType() {
    switch (currentQType) {
      case "Single-Choice":
        let SCresults = SC.createTests(this.qData.project);
        return SCresults;

      default:
        alert(
          `ERROR: Unable to detect question type for question ${currentQNumber}`
        );
    }
  }
}
